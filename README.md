### Poem: Whispers of Pride and Prejudice

In a world of letters, ink, and sighs,  
Where hearts entwine beneath the skies,  
A tale unfolds with grace and wit,  
Of love and mischief, where two souls fit.

With pride and prejudice, they dance and weave,  
In manners and mores, their truths deceive;  
Yet through the pages, passion’s light,  
Ignites the darkness, sets wrongs to right.

Each fold and letter, secrets untold,  
In whispers of longing, their stories unfold;  
Elizabeth’s spirit, and Darcy’s proud heart,  
Craft a romance that won’t soon depart.

So gather, dear reader, let’s turn each page,  
Embrace the wisdom of Austen’s age;  
For in her words, we find a mirror,  
Reflecting our hearts, growing ever nearer.
